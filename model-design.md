This notebook contains an outline of the structure for the GAN model for ultrasound image tracking, by generating DVFs for image registration. The model is based on the paper [Deep learning-based motion tracking using ultrasound images ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34724712/) by Dai et al. (2021).
Including:
- The generator and discriminator networks
- The spatial transformer network
- The dataset class
- The loss functions
- The optimizers
- And the helper functions for preprocessing, landmark extraction, and evaluation. 
- The steps for training the model and evaluating its performance are also included.

# Steps:

- Load and preprocess the ultrasound image sequences from CAMUS dataset
- Load and preprocess segmentation maps from CAMUS dataset
- Find, select, label, and save landmarks from segmentation maps
- Define tracked and untracked frames for each sequence
- Create dataloaders for tracked and untracked frames using torch.utils.data.DataLoader
- Train the generator and discriminator networks using adversarial learning
- Use the trained generator network to estimate DVFs and shift landmarks for each pair of tracked and untracked frames
- Evaluate the performance of the GAN by calculating TE and comparing with other methods

# Challenges:

- Generator takes image 1 image 2  - Generates estimated DVF
- Discriminator takes i1 and DVF and outputs a probability
- How does the discriminator compute the similarity between the two images?
- Need a GAN architecture that generates DVFs from the moving image to the fixed image.
- Then uses a Spatial Transformer Network (STN) to warp the moving image to the fixed image.
- Then the discriminator is used to determine if the warped frame is the same as the fixed image.
- DVFs should be same shape as the image.
